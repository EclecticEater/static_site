  	<h2 class="section">Summary</h2>
  	<p>
  	Experienced cybersecurity professional who assists clients with improving their cybersecurity posture for clients that have a single IT employee, and for clients that have hundreds of security personnel around the globe. I continuously 
	seek to improve my knowledge through technical certifications such as the AWS Solutions Architect Professional and Security - Specialty and home lab projects such as a personal blog developed in .Net that I deployed on Azure using the MVC 
	architecture, an AWS app that scrapes a website and notifies me when new anime episodes are out, and the website you are currently viewing. <br>

	In my spare time, I enjoy modding/repairing retro gaming consoles.
